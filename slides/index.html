# HTTP by Example

## HTTP/1, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3

Webnesday 2025

Roman Ehrbar

???

- Preparation
  - Open terminal in root for demo/questions.

- Questions to audience:
  - Who would say he/she masters http in all versions?

- The promise is to show the features on some examples, and not every detail.
- The RFC are all available online and Mozilla Developer Network MDN has in depth articles.

---
# History

<img src="tbl_photo.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto" alt="Tim Berners-Lee in 1994 with his web browser." />

???

- Who is this? Tim Berners-Lee
- He has less hairs, and the ones still there are gray.
- Around 1994 with his own browser.

---

# History

- Idea of Hypertext was born (universal library with interlinked documents since 1960).
- Documents usually shipped on floppy disks.
- TCP/IP was standardized.
- Non standardized hard- and software.

???

- Interesting backstory, but too much for this talk. It's a rabbit hole.

---

# History

- Development of ...
  - standard protocol for retrieving documents.
  - standard format for representing documents.
  - program to serve documents over the network.
  - program to view retrieved text documents and graphics.

Request:

```
GET /my-page.html
```

Response:

```text
<html>
  An text-only web page
</html>
```
???

- In short: HTTP, HTML and a Browser.
  - Graphical Browser in NeXTSTEP workstations (objective-c), but were not portable enough.
  - _Line Mode_ browser.
- Typical client-server protocol, request initiated by the recipient.
- Designed to be human readable.
- Only supported method was `GET`
- No headers or status codes.
- Did not have a version at the time, was later named `HTTP/0.9`.

---

# Basic HTTP Server

contents of `minimal.http`:

```http
HTTP/1.0 200 OK

<h1>Hi Webnesday
```
???
- This will be the first building block, defining the response.
- Notice the empty line, which is used to separate the metadata from the body.
- This is true for requests and responses. Used for example in POST requests.
- Technically, a GET request can also have a body, but it may lead to undefined behavior.
--

serving the file:

```sh
while true; do cat minimal.http | nc -l 8000 -q 1; done
```

???

- Connection is handled by the transport layer, provided here with netcat.
- The loop is required for repeated connections.
- When the HTTP version is omitted, it will not be rendered in firefox, but detected as HTTP/0.9.
- This minimal example is not well formed, but most browser will accept this.

---

# Basic HTTP Server

<img src="demo_minimal_http.png" alt="minimal http response rendered in firefox." style="width: 100%" />

???

- Could switch to browser and console for demo.
- As you see, rendered perfectly.

---

# HTTP/1.0

```http
GET /my-page.html HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: NCSA_Mosaic/2.0 (Windows 3.1)
```

```http
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT
Server: CERN/3.0 libwww/2.17
Content-Type: text/html

<HTML>
  A page with an image
  <IMG SRC="/my-image.gif">
</HTML>
```


???

- Example sourced from MDN
- Additions:
  - Version in request and response
  - Status code line in response
  - Headers for extension, state management and content information (images).
- Describe Anatomy:
  - Method: GET, HEAD, POST
  - Path
  - Headers
  - Status Code; Status Message
- _try-and-see_ approach implemented by servers and browsers, to see which feature got traction.

---

# HTTP/1.1

First standardized version of HTTP in 1997.

```http
GET /en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS-safelisted_request_header HTTP/1.1
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Referer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS-safelisted_request_header
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: Keep-Alive
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 20 Jul 2016 10:55:30 GMT
Etag: "547fa7e369ef56031dd3bff2ace9fc0832eb251a"
Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=1000
Last-Modified: Tue, 19 Jul 2016 00:59:33 GMT
Server: Apache
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Vary: Cookie, Accept-Encoding
```

???

- Connection reuse
- Chunked response
- Cache control
- Content negotiation: language, encoding and type
- `Host` header allows to host different domains from the same IP address.
- More features have been omitted to keep it short.
- Was stable for many years, but finally split up to allow for the updated versions.

---

# HTTP/2

<img src="http2_wireshark.png" style="width: 100%" />

???

- Binary protocol, not human readable anymore.
  - This is why it is shown using wireshark.
- Requires TLS in most modern browsers. Cleartext is in some cases possible.
  - Hint on TLS-Frame
- Requires upgrade header or prior knowledge (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation inside TLS).
- Use `export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/tmp/ssl_key.log` before starting a browser to decrypt the traffic.
- Multiplexing, reuse existing TCP-Connection for multiple resources.
  - Hint on multiple blocks, `NO 629`.
  - Previously used multiple TCP-Connections, usually limited to 6 per domain.
- Compression of headers (HPACK).
  - Static Tables: for example `:scheme` or `:method` (good compression, both use one byte each)
  - Dynamic Tables: reuse previous headers
- Saves budget for data transfer overhead.

---

# HTTP/2

<img src="http2_firefox.png" style="width: 100%" />

???

- Headers will be reconstructed by the browser developer tools.
- Only indicator is `Version: HTTP/2`
- Only update the server, no significant work for web developers. Disable compression, as HTTP/2 has own context-aware compression.
- Standardized in 2015, peaked in 2021 with more than 49%.

---

# HTTP/3

<img src="http3_wireshark.png" style="width: 100%" />

???

- Keep same semantics as previous versions of HTTP.
- Uses _QUIC_ instead of TCP, running multiple streams over UDP with packet loss detection and retransmission.
- Combines the handshake with TLS. Usually no unencrypted connections.
- Falls back to HTTP/TCP if UDP is blocked or MTU is too small.
- Reduces `Head-of-line-Blocking` usually seen in unstable networks.
  - Requires lots of TCP retransmits.
  - Improves experience for mobile users.
- Took the lead over HTTP/2 just this year (April 2025).

---

# HTTP/3

<img src="http3_firefox.png" style="width: 100%" />

???

- Not that different than previous version.
- Only indicator is `Version: HTTP/3`
- Header `Alt-Svc` indicates there are other protocols available and the browser is allowed to memorize it.
  - Save some time on following connections.


---

# Summary

| Feature | HTTP/1.1 | HTTP/2 | HTTP/3 |
|-|-|-|-|
|Protocol type|text based|binary|binary (QUIC)|
|Connection|TCP|TCP|UDP|
|Multiplexing|no|yes|yes|
|TLS|optional|recommended|required|
|Complexity|low|medium|high|
|Goals|compatability|performance|mobility|

???
- All versions share the common structure.
- Can I use http/3: Baseline 2024, since September.

- Questions to audience:
  - Who still thinks there was nothing noteworthy in these slides? Challenge to do it better at next webnesday.
