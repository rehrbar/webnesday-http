# History

<img src="tbl_photo.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto" alt="Tim Berners-Lee in 1994 with his web browser." />

???

- Who is this? Tim Berners-Lee
- He has less hairs, and the ones still there are gray.
- Around 1994 with his own browser.

---

# History

- Idea of Hypertext was born (universal library with interlinked documents).
- Documents usually shipped on floppy disks.
- TCP/IP was standardized.

???

Interesting backstory, but too much for this talk. It's a rabbit hole.

# Summary

???

- Questions to audience:
  - Who still thinks there was nothing noteworthy in these slides? Challenge to do it better at next webnesday.
